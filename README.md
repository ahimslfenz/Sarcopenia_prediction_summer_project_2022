# Sarcopenia_prediction_summer_project_2022
ABSTRACT

Background/Purpose: Sarcopenia is a portent factor in patients with head and neck cancer (HNC), of which there is significant loss of strength and muscle mass. Predicting the presence of sarcopenia can be advantageous when considering how to alter radiotherapy or other dosages in the treatment of cancer. Being aware of, or accurately predicting, sarcopenia in a HNC patient can aid in the assessment of treatment plans and mortality rates.  

Methods: The dataset used was one of 200 patients from the TCIA Head and Neck collection. Clinical variables included sex, age, pre-RT skeletal muscle status, pre-RT L3 adipose tissue cross sectional area, smoker status, and post-RT skeletal muscle status. We then used logistic regression. Performance was measured using accuracy and an ROC curve.  

Results: The accuracy score was 0.6163, recall was 0.88, and precision was 0.6197. The ROC curve had an AUC of 0.68.  

Conclusions: Using commonly available clinical data, we successfully built a sarcopenia prediction model. Future models could improve performance and accuracy by incorporating imaging data and Deep Learning programs.
